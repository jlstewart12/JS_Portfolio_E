While I strive to grasp the most relevant technologies used to conquer challenges both common and colossal, I think the most groundbreaking innovations come from collaboration practiced by a diverse set of perspectives and talents. Having experienced the power of teamwork firsthand, I tend to gravitate towards cultures that foster it and work to cultivate it in it's absence. My initiatives for transforming data into insights while including a variety of efforts have become sources of inspiration for organizations across many industries.</p>
